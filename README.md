BOSH-Lite Deployment Template
======================================

This repository acts as an upstream repository of YAML templates for use
in deploying one or more BOSH Lites, via the [Gensis][1] utility.



Creating a new BOSH-Lite Deployment
======================================

To create a new [Genesis][1]-based deployment of BOSH-Lite, run

    genesis new deployment --template bosh-lite

This will create a new repo called `bosh-lite-deployments` for you, and
pull in the `github.com/starkandwayne/bosh-lite-deployment` repo as the
`upstream` remote, copying the contents of `global/*` into the new
`bosh-lite-deployments` repository.

This allows you to easily diverge from the upstream templates to suit your
environment, yet still be able to pull in changes from upstream down
the road.


vSphere Sites
======================================

The `vsphere` template will set you up with a structure suitable
for deploying BOSH Lites on a VMWare vSphere ESXi cluster.

    genesis new site --template vsphere <name>


Amazon EC2 (AWS) Sites
======================================

The `aws` template will set you up with a structure suitable for
deploying BOSH Lites to Amazon Web Service's EC2/VPC
infrastructure.

    genesis new site --template aws <name>


Open Stack Sites
======================================

The `openstack` template will set you up with a structure suitable for
deploying BOSH Lites to an Open Stack infrastructure.

    genesis new site --template openstack <name>


Google Cloud Platform (Google) Sites
======================================

The `google` template will set you up with a structure suitable for
deploying BOSH Lites to Google Cloud Plaftorm infrastructure.

    genesis new site --template google <name>



vCloud Director (vCloud) Sites
======================================

The `vcloud` template will set you up with a structure suitable for
deploying BOSH Lites to vCloud Director infrastructure.

    genesis new site --template vcloud <name>
